# NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions — Data Science Tutorial
### CMSC 320: Introduction to Data Science | Spring 2026 | University of Maryland

---

## Overview

This repository contains a data science tutorial analyzing the **NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions (Crashes)** dataset published by the NYPD via [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data).

We will walk through the full data science pipeline — from data acquisition and preprocessing to exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and machine learning — to uncover patterns in crash severity, contributing factors, and borough-level trends across New York City.

> **Status:** Project just started. Currently in Checkpoint 1 — dataset selected, repository initialized.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [NYC Open Data — Motor Vehicle Collisions (Crashes)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data)
- **Reported by:** New York Police Department (NYPD)
- **Size:** 2M+ rows, updated regularly
- **Features include:** crash date/time, borough, latitude/longitude, contributing factors, vehicle types, and injury/fatality counts

## Research Questions

- What factors (time of day, borough, vehicle type, contributing factor) are most associated with crash severity?
- Can we predict whether a collision will result in injuries or fatalities based on available features?
- Are certain boroughs or times of day statistically more dangerous than others?
